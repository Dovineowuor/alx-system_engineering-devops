## Synopsis
This project introduces and applies concepts of web stack debugging

### Resources

man: `curl`

The Webstack debugging series will train you to the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that's the "fun" part of the job!). Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master it.
																															
Note that as you cannot use interactive software such as `emacs` or `vi` in your Bash script, everything needs to be done from the command line (including file edition).
																																
### Project Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- Your Bash scripts must pass `Shellcheck` without any error
- Your Bash scripts must run without error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
